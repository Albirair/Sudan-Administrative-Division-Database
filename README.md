A set of SQL transactions intended to create and populate 2 tables representing **Sudan**'s administrative division as states composed of localities.
 
The names of localities have been obtained from [Sudan Presidency website](https://www.presidency.gov.sd/page/About-States?fbclid=IwAR1ihjCbE8o7JFrUEIOSpEGNBy-H7Wx_2c3fEhjg5coycbDmhjOQm68NgLU), although effort has been made to retrieve the English names from "authoritative" sources, some had been translated by [Albirair](https://github.com/Albirair).
